You can go investigate tensors as training proceeds, drill down into individual neurons, inspect single data sets that are of special interest to you, track gradients, compare statistics between different training runs, and more.<p>This tool has saved me a ton of time in my research by letting me check my hypotheses much more quickly than normal and by helping me understand how the different parts of my network really interact.<p>I hope this tool can save other people just as much time as it did me.

We’re Brad and Scott from Nullstone (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nullstone.io"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nullstone.io</a>), a developer platform to deploy and manage cloud apps and infrastructure. Here’s a demo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;924b1f57ba2143eeabb43ee8cbe3fe88?sid=91afe471-e5ac-462d-829a-1f762f3ab2fd"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;924b1f57ba2143eeabb43ee8cbe3fe88?...</a>.<p>Running your app on a major cloud provider makes a lot of things easier, but it’s tedious to configure IAM, security groups, networking, secrets, autoscaling, health checks, zero-downtime deployments, and more. It is also difficult and time-consuming to release and synchronize app and infra changes across many apps and environments.<p>Nullstone provides an intuitive developer experience to deploy any app—be it an API, web app, static site, or one-off job—to AWS or GCP. We provide a simple, consistent experience for automatically deploying to any platform (e.g., Fargate, Kubernetes, Lambda, etc.). We provision and configure infrastructure depending on your use case (e.g., networks, clusters, datastores, load balancers, third-party logging providers, and much more). We offer many features that are hard to build in-house: automatic secrets management, GitOps, and preview environments.<p>Everything runs in your own cloud accounts. You own your data and we cannot access it. Secrets are stored in your secrets manager. We support all app types (e.g. APIs, web apps, frontends, jobs, etc.) and platforms (e.g. containers, serverless, s3 sites, VMs, etc.).<p>Instead of being a black box, our infrastructure modules are open source and you can hot-swap each module for your own Terraform. You can automate deploys and preview environments via GitHub integrations, CI&#x2F;CD integrations, CLI, or API. All infra&#x2F;deploy logs are easily accessible through the UI, CLI, and API.<p>We scan our modules against compliance frameworks to provide a foundation of compliance for your infrastructure. If there are vendors or platforms we don’t support, we provide a quick framework and open hooks to add support.<p>Nullstone is intended for software teams that don’t want to build an in-house platform. Our customers span many industries and have used us to reduce cloud costs by up to 90%, provide developer self-service, fully automate deployments, migrate to containers, and more.<p>Previously, we built an internal developer platform at McKinsey (serving 300 workloads across 1000 engineers) to solve a major pain point: engineers were building apps in weeks only to wait months to provision and secure infrastructure (and once provisioned, making changes to the apps was a frustrating back-and-forth process). Later I joined a cybersecurity company and as our team grew, I saw the same challenges: we were spending more time configuring infrastructure than building the product.<p>We decided to build Nullstone because no existing solution fit our needs. Some of the products we found were all-in-one solutions, meaning we had to sacrifice the tooling we liked and use infrastructure with insufficient security, compliance, and reliability controls. Other products, built for enterprises, provide a poor developer experience in exchange for costly licenses and significant internal resources to operate.<p>To provide a fully customizable experience that is easy-to-use for developers, we had to solve a few problems. (1) We had to present infrastructure as code configuration in a way that isn’t overwhelming, but allows for flexibility to handle various architectures. (2) We had to insulate developers from infrastructure-as-code errors that would confuse them, while maintaining a level of transparency that devs demand. (3) We had to build tooling around module development because infrastructure takes 10x longer than app code to get feedback on whether it’s working properly.<p>Nullstone is free for individual use. After that, we charge $100&#x2F;user&#x2F;month. A user is anybody committing code that is deployed through Nullstone.<p>Our docs are at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nullstone.io&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nullstone.io&#x2F;</a> and our public roadmap is at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orgs&#x2F;nullstone-io&#x2F;projects&#x2F;1&#x2F;views&#x2F;1"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orgs&#x2F;nullstone-io&#x2F;projects&#x2F;1&#x2F;views&#x2F;1</a>.<p>We would love for you to try it out and give us feedback, and we look forward to your comments!",1693920073,Launch HN: Nullstone (YC W22) – An easier way to deploy and manage cloud apps,story

Companies may stop supporting a device well before consumers have stopped using it. The support period is often not communicated at the time of sale. And sometimes the end of support is not even announced, leaving even informed users unsure whether their devices are still safe.<p>I’ve advocated for the FCC to require device manufacturers to support their devices with security updates for a reasonable amount of time [1]. I can&#x27;t bring such a proposal to a vote since I’m not the chairman of the agency. But I was able to convince my colleagues to tentatively support something a little more moderate addressing this problem.<p>The FCC recently issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [2] for a cybersecurity labeling program for connected devices. If they meet certain criteria for the security of their product, manufacturers can put an FCC cybersecurity label on it. I fought hard for one of these criteria to be the disclosure of how long the product will receive security updates. I hope that, besides arming consumers with better information, the commitments on this label (including the support period) will be legally enforceable in contract and tort lawsuits and under other laws. You can see my full statement here [3].<p>But it’s too early to declare victory. Many manufacturers oppose making any commitments about security updates, even voluntary ones. These manufacturers are heavily engaged at the FCC and represented by sophisticated regulatory lawyers. The FCC and White House are not likely to take a strong stand if they only hear the device manufacturer&#x27;s side of the story.<p>In short, they need to hear from you. You have experienced insecure protocols, exposed private keys, and other atrocious security. You have seen these problems persist despite ample warning. People ask, ‘why aren’t there rules about these things?’ This is your chance to get on the record and tell us what you think the rules should be. If infosec doesn’t make this an issue, the general public will continue falsely assuming that everything is fine. But if you get on the record and the government fails to act, the evidence of this failure will be all over the Internet forever.<p>If you want to influence the process, you have until September 25th, 2023 (midnight ET) to file comments in the rulemaking proceeding.[4] Filing is easy: go to <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;ecfs&#x2F;search&#x2F;docket-detail&#x2F;23-239"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;ecfs&#x2F;search&#x2F;docket-detail&#x2F;23-239</a> and click to file either an ‘express’ comment (type into a textbox) or a ‘standard’ comment (upload a PDF). Either way, the FCC is required to consider your arguments. All options are on the table, so don’t hold back, but do make your arguments as clear as possible, so even lawyers can understand them. If you have a qualification (line of work, special degree, years of experience, etc.) that would bolster the credibility of your official comment, be sure to mention that, but the only necessary qualification is being an interested member of the public.<p>I’m here to listen and learn. AMA. Feel free to ask any questions about this or related issues, and I’ll answer as many as I can. I just ask that we try to stay on the topic of security. My legal advisor, Marco Peraza, a security-focused software engineer turned cybersecurity lawyer, will be answering questions too.   
I’m open to incorporating your ideas (and even being convinced I’m wrong), and I hope that my colleagues at the FCC are as well. Thank you!<p>Edit: The Q&amp;A is over now, but please keep this great discussion going without us. Thanks again everyone for your input. Don&#x27;t forget to file comments if you want to make sure your arguments get considered by the full FCC.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;document&#x2F;simington-calls-mandatory-security-updates"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;document&#x2F;simington-calls-mandatory-secur...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;document&#x2F;fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labeling-program-smart-devices"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;document&#x2F;fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labe...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;document&#x2F;fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labeling-program-smart-devices&#x2F;simington-statement"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;document&#x2F;fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labe...</a><p>[4] If your comments are purely in response to arguments made in other comments, you have an extra 15 days, until October 10, 2023.",1693926441,Ask HN: I’m an FCC Commissioner proposing regulation of IoT security updates,story

This is Jeane and Samuel and we’re building RecipeUI. RecipeUI is an open source Postman alternative that uses TypeScript to statically type and autocomplete requests.<p>We built this because current API tools don’t deal with the fact that some APIs are just painful to work with. For us, it’s usually error after error as we try to figure out how to properly form the first request.<p>We recorded a demo to show you how TypeScript helps us autocomplete a request correctly.
<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;O_Mly_p-g5s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;O_Mly_p-g5s</a><p>How does our platform improve the developer experience? The analogy is similar to using a statically typed language vs dynamically typed. Most API tools are dynamically typed. You’re guessing the params and relying on the request to magically work at runtime, only for you to go back to stack overflow or the docs when it doesn’t.<p>We take the approach of defining parameters and the schema first. When you add a new parameter, you need to mention upfront if it’s required and what type it is (integer, string, boolean). While this can be painful in the beginning, it will save you and anyone you share this with the hassle of understanding how this API works.<p>Our app is cross-platform on web and desktop. Our desktop app is &lt;20mb and built on top of Rust with Tauri, NextJS, and Supabase. We open source our code because we want to be transparent about how API requests and secrets are handled (all local IndexDB).<p>I built the first version of this at Robinhood when my colleagues were sharing bash scripts and internal APIs on slack to test things. I wanted to make it easier for anyone to use an API quickly and made use of our OpenAPI specs to generate a nice autocomplete API tool. Soon after, the Options team, then the Crypto team, and then the whole eng org at Robinhood adopted this tool!<p>Try it out at recipeui.com!
